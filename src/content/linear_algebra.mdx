# Linear Algebra

## What is Linear Algebra?
Linear algebra is the study of mathematical objects that you can add:

$$
a+b
$$
and that you can multiply by numbers

$$
5a.
$$

A vector space is a set where you can add elements of the set together and where you can multiply any element in the set by a number.

For example, the set of pairs of numbers (things like $(-1, 0)$ or $(5, 7)$ or $(1.5, 2.5)$, $(3, 5)$ etc) form a vector space:
- you can add any two of them together: $(-1, 0) + (5, 7) = (4, 7)$
- you can multiply any of them by a number: $0.5\cdot(3, 5) = (1.5, 2.5)$.

For example, the set of triples of numbers (things like $(-1, 0, 0)$ or $(3, 2, 1)$ or $(-2.4, 1.6, 0)$) form a vector space:
- you can add any two of them together: $(-1, 0, 0) + (3, 2, 1) = (2, 2, 1)$
- you can multiply any of them by a number: $2\cdot(3, 2, 1) = (6, 4, 2)$

Similarly for quadruples of numbers, quintuples of numbers, $n$-tuples of numbers.

The set of pairs of numbers is called $\bbR^2$. The set of triples of numbers is called $\bbR^3$. The set of $n$-tuples of numbers is called $\bbR^n$. There are more vector spaces than these, but it is helpful to just focus on these vector spaces first.

There are two other vector spaces not mentioned thus far, but that are important. First, the set of numbers themselves, $\bbR$, forms a vector space. And the set containing only zero, $\{0\}$, is a vector space.

## Linear Systems of Equations
In practice, most problems in linear algebra reduce to solving systems of linear equations. This is a linear equation in two variables:
$$
x + 2y = 3
$$
It is linear because it can be written as a sum of numbers times the variables. There are no powers bigger than 1 ($x^2$) or funky functions ($\sin(x)$) lying around. If this definition seems unsatisfying and unintuitive, that's ok. We'll revisit it in the future.

The set of solutions to the equation $x + 2y = 3$ is the set of pairs of numbers $(x, y)$ such that $x + 2y = 3$. For example, $(1, 1)$ is a solution, as is $(3, 0)$.

The set of pairs of numbers can be plotted on the cartesian axis:
<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1]} />
  <Point location={[3, 0]} />
</Axes>

Pictured above are two solutions to the equation $x + 2y = 3$. If you plot enough solutions, you see that they form a line:
<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1]} />
  <Point location={[3, 0]} />
  <Point location={[0, 1.5]} />
  <Point location={[-1, 2]} />
  <Point location={[2, 0.5]} />
  <Point location={[3, 0]} />
  <Point location={[4, -0.5]} />
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y - 3} opacity={0.5} color={'blue'}/>
</Axes>

Therefore I might refer to "the line $x + 2y = 3$". This means the same thing as "the set of pairs of points $(x, y)$ such that $x + 2y = 3$" and the same thing as "the set of solutions to $x + 2y = 3$".

Here is a linear equation, in three variables:
$$
x + 2y - z = 1.
$$
The set of solutions of this equation is the set of triples of numbers $(x, y, z)$ such that $x + 2y -z = 1$. For example, $(1, 1, 2)$ is a solution, as is $(-1, 1.5, 1)$.

The set of triples of numbers can be plotted on a 3-dimensional cartesian axis:
<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1, 2]} />
  <Point location={[-1, 1.5, 1]} />
</Axes>

Above I have plotted two solutions to $x + 2y - z = 1$. If you plot lots of solutions, you can see that they form a plane:
<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1, 2]} />
  <Point location={[-1, 1.5, 1]} />
  <Point location={[2, 1, 3]} />
  <Point location={[2, -1, -1]} />
  <Point location={[0, 0.5, 0]} />
  <Point location={[0, 2.5, 4]} />
  <Point location={[-0.5, 0, -1.5]} />
  <Point location={[0, 0, -1]} />
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
</Axes>

(How did I get these solutions? I fixed two of the coordinates and then determined the third. For example, for $(1, 1, 2)$, I said "suppose $x=1$ and $y=1$, then $z$ must be such that $1 + (2\cdot 1) - z = 1$, so $z$ must be $1 + 2 - 1 = 2$".) Therefore, I might refer to "the plane $x + 2y - z = 1$", which is the same thing as "the set of pairs of points $(x, y)$ such that $x + 2y - z = 1$" which is the same as "the set of solutions to $x + 2y - z = 1$".

A system of linear equations is a set of linear equations, like

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3
\\ 2x + y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

The solutions to this system of equations are all the pairs of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations. For example $(-1, 2)$ is a solution to this system of equations. In fact it's the only solution. You see, if $(x, y)$ satisfies the first equation, then it lies on the line $x + 2y = 3$:

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y - 3} opacity={0.5} color={'blue'}/>
</Axes>

and if it satisfies the second equation it lies on the line $2x + y = 0$:

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => 2*x + y} opacity={0.5} color={'green'}/>
</Axes>

so if it satisfies both equations, then it lies on both lines:

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y - 3} opacity={0.5} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => 2*x + y} opacity={0.5} color={'green'}/>
</Axes>

As you can, see $(-1, 2)$ is the only point lying on both lines.

Some systems of equations have no solutions. For example, when the two equations represent parallel lines:

<table style={{width: '100%'}}>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: '25%'}}>

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3\\
x + 2y = -1
\end{cases}
$$

</td>

<td style={{width: '75%'}}>

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y - 3} opacity={0.5} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y + 1} opacity={0.5} color={'green'}/>
</Axes>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



Other systems of equation have infinitely many solutions. For example, when the two equations represent the same line:

<table style={{width: '100%'}}>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: '25%'}}>

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3\\
2x + 4y = 6
\end{cases}
$$

</td>

<td style={{width: '75%'}}>

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y - 3} opacity={0.5} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => 2*x + 4*y - 6} opacity={0.5} color={'green'}/>
</Axes>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>





Another way a system of equations in two variables can have no solutions is if there are three equations but their lines do not all intersect in the same point. For example, the system

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3\\
2x + y = 0\\
y = 1
\end{cases}
$$

has solutions given by the intersection of the three lines $x + 2y = 3$, $2x + y = 0$, and $y = 1$. But when you graph these lines, you see that no point lies on all three of them:

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y - 3} opacity={0.5} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => 2*x + y} opacity={0.5} color={'green'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => y - 1} opacity={0.5} color={'purple'}/>
</Axes>

so this system has no solutions.


You can have systems of equations of three variables, for example

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 1 \\
2x + z = -1
\end{cases}
$$

The solutions to this system of equations are the triples $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy both equations. If a triple satisfies the first equation, it lies on the plane $x + 2y - z = 1$. If it satisfies the second equation, it lies on the plane $2x + z = -1$. If it satisfies both equations, it must lie on the intersection of the two planes:

<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => 2*x + z + 1} opacity={0.25} color={'green'}/>
</Axes>

As you can see, the intersection of the two planes is a line, so the solutions to the system form a line. For example, here two solutions are $(1, -1.5, -3)$ and $(0, 0, -1)$, and you can see that they lie on the line of intersection:

<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => 2*x + z + 1} opacity={0.25} color={'green'}/>
  <Point location={[1, -1.5, -3]} />
  <Point location={[0, 0, -1]} />
  <LineSegment start={[2, -3, -5]} end={[-3, 4.5, 5]} color={'orange'} />
</Axes>

There are, of course, infinitely many solutions to the system since there are infinitely many points on the line.

Here is a system of three linear equations in three variables:

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 1 \\
2x + z = -1\\
-3x -2y + 2z = 2
\end{cases}
$$

The solutions to each equation correspond to a plane. Therefore the points $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy all three equations are the points in the intersection of these three planes. As you can see, there is just a single point that lies in all three planes:

<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => 2*x + z + 1} opacity={0.25} color={'green'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => -3*x - 2*y + 2*z - 2} opacity={0.25} color={'purple'}/>
</Axes>

It turns out that this solution is $(-1, 1.5, 1)$:
<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => 2*x + z + 1} opacity={0.25} color={'green'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => -3*x - 2*y + 2*z - 2} opacity={0.25} color={'purple'}/>
  <Point location={[-1, 3/2, 1]} />
</Axes>

Most of the time, a system of three linear equations in three variables has a single solution. Sometimes, however, all three planes could intersect in the same line, in which case there are a line's worth of solutions. For example, in the system

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 1\\
2x + z = -1\\
3x + 2y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

all three planes intersect in the orange line pictured:

<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => 2*x + z + 1} opacity={0.25} color={'green'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => 3*x + 2*y} opacity={0.25} color={'purple'}/>
  <LineSegment start={[2, -3, -5]} end={[-3, 4.5, 5]} color={'orange'} />
</Axes>

You can have systems of linear equations in three variables that have no solutions. For example, you can have two parallel planes, as in this system:

<table style={{width: '100%'}}>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: '25%'}}>

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 1\\
-x -2y + z = 1
\end{cases}
$$

</td>

<td style={{width: '75%'}}>

<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z + 1} opacity={0.25} color={'green'}/>
</Axes>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>




or you can three equations, two of which represent parallel planes, as in this system:


<table style={{width: '100%'}}>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: '25%'}}>

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 1\\
-x -2y + z = 1\\
-3x -2y + 2z = 2
\end{cases}
$$

</td>

<td style={{width: '75%'}}>

<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z + 1} opacity={0.25} color={'green'}/>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => -3*x - 2*y + 2*z - 2} opacity={0.25} color={'purple'}/>
</Axes>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

the solution of whose individual equations are the planes:



Lastly, consider the following system of four equations in three variables:
$$
\begin{cases}
x = 0 \\
y = 0 \\
z = 0 \\
x + y + z = 3
\end{cases}
$$

Here any three of the planes have a single commont point, but no point lies in all four, so the system has no solutions:
<Axes three bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'} />
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => y} opacity={0.25} color={'green'} />
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => z} opacity={0.25} color={'purple'} />
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + y + z - 3} opacity={0.25} color={'pink'} />
</Axes>

There are other configurations, possible, of course (three equations that each represent the same plane so that the system has a plane's worth of solutions; or four equations that represent planes that have a single common point of intersection; etc), but this is enough for now.

## Solving Systems of Linear Equations

What are the solutions to the system of equations?

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3\\
2x + y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

There are many ways of answering this question, and here is one. It hinges on two observations:

1. If $(x, y)$ satisfies $x + 2y = 3$, then they must also satisfy $2x + 4y = 6$. That is, I can multiply an equation by a nonzero constant and the system's solutions don't change.

2. If $(x, y)$ satisfies $x + 2y = 3$ and $2x + y = 0$, then $(x, y)$ also satisfies the sum of these two equations, $3x + 3y = 3$, because if $x + 2y = 3$ and $2x + y = 0$ then $(x + 2y) + (2x + y) = 3 + 0 = 3$. Combining this with the prior observation: I can add a multiple of one equation to another and the system's solutions don't change.

There is a third observation that you or may not want to use in solving the system:

3. If you switch two of the equations, the system's solutions don't change. That is, the solutions to the system

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3\\
2x + y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

and the system

$$
\begin{cases}
2x + y = 0\\
x + 2y = 3
\end{cases}
$$

are the same.

Using the observations, proceed:

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3\\
2x + y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

add $-2$ times the second equation to the first

$$
\begin{cases}
-3x = 3\\
2x + y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

multiply the first equation by $-1/3$:

$$
\begin{cases}
x = -1\\
2x + y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

add $-2$ times the first equation to the second

$$
\begin{cases}
x = -1\\
y = 2
\end{cases}
$$

At every step of the way, the system of equations changed, but the solution did not. You can see this clearly when I graph the solutions to each equation as lines:

The steps here are determined by a strategy to reduce each equation to have a single variable. Knowing which steps to take comes with practice.

The example presented here is a system of two equations in two variables. For systems with more variables, it helps to organize the system of equations into little boxes called "augmented matrices", best described by example:

The three operations that change a system without changing its solutions can rewritten in terms of rows:

1. Multiply a row by a nonzero constant
2. Add a multiple of one row to another
3. Swap two rows

It is worthwhile going through solving the system

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 3\\
2x + y = 0
\end{cases}

It's worth going over an example of a system of three equations in three variables:

$$
\begin{cases}
x + 2y - z = 1 \\
2x + z = -1\\
-3x -2y + 2z = 2
\end{cases}
$$

As with the system of two equations and two variables, solve this by using the three row operations to eliminate variables from the equations until there's just a single variable in each equation:


<table style={{width: '100%'}}>

At this point the system has been simplified enough that we can read off its only solution: $(-1, 1.5, 1)$.

In both of the previous examples, the augmented matrix was transformed to a simpler form by the three row operations:

$$
  \baug{cc|c}
  1 & 2 & 3\\
  2 & 1 & 0
  \eaug

  \to 

  \baug{cc|c}
  1  & 0 & -1\\
  0 & 1 & 2
  \eaug
$$

$$
  \baug{ccc|c}
  1 & 2 & -1 & 1\\
  2 & 0 & 1 & -1\\
  -3 & -2 & 2 & 2
  \eaug

  \to

  \baug{ccc|c}
  0 & 1 & 0 & 3/2\\
  1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1
  \eaug
$$

The benefit of this work is that, in the simpler form, the solution to the system is immediately clear.

## Row Reduction

Mathematicians have come up with a "simplest form" of an augmented matrix called "reduced row echelon form". An augmented matrix is in reduced row echelon form (rref) if

- For each row, the first column left of the vertical line with a nonzero entry in that row is a column of all zeros except for a 1 in that row. These columns are called pivot columns.
- The pivot columns are ordered by their nonzero rows. That is, the pivot column for row $i$ must precede the pivot colum for row $j$ if $i < j$.
- If there are $k$ pivot columns, then they must be the pivot columns for rows $1,\ldots, k$.

Here are some examples:

The definition of reduced row echelon form is a human construction of convenience, rather than some central concept foisted on us by the abstract laws of math, but it turns out to be useful. One of the most important facts is that every augmented matrix can be transformed by row operations to a unique rref augmented matrix.

To "row-reduce" a matrix means to repeatedly apply the three row-operations to transform it into a matrix in reduced row echelon form. For example:

Because the row operations do not change the solution to the augmented matrix, the row-reduced augmented matrix has the same solution set as the original augmented matrix. You can see this in the previous example where, at every stage, each pair of planes intersects in the same line.

## Vectors

Vectors are quantities that you both add and multiply by scalars. For example, $\bbR^2$, the set of pairs of numbers, consists of vectors (we call it a "vector space"): given two elements in $\bbR^2$, for example $(2, 3)$ and $(-1, 1)$, then you can add them together to get another element in $\bbR^2$:

$$
(2, 3) + (-1, 1) = (1, 4)
$$        

and given an element of $\bbR^2$ and a number, for example $(2, 3)$ and $5$, you can multiply the element of $\bbR^2$ by the number:

$$
5\cdot (2, 3) = (10, 15)
$$

Because the number $5$ "scales" the vector $(2, 3)$, this operation is called scalar multiplication.

Similarly, elements of $\bbR^3$ (triples of numbers) form a vector space (again, vector space = set of vectors):

$$
(2, 3, 1) + (-1, 1, 0) = (1, 4, 1)
$$

$$
5 \cdot (2, 3, 1) = (10, 15, 5)
$$

and elements of $\bbR^4$:

$$
(2, 3, 1, 0) + (-1, 1, 0, 2) = (1, 4, 1, 2)
$$
$$
5 \cdot (2, 3, 1, 0) = (10, 15, 5, 0)
$$

and in general the set of $n$-tuples of numbers, $\bbR^n$ forms a vector space:

$$
(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) + (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_n + b_n)
$$
$$
c\cdot (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = (ca_1, ca_2, \ldots, ca_n).
$$

The set of lists of single numbers, $\bbR^1$, forms a vector space too, of course. However $\bbR^0$ refers not to lists of zero numbers (whatever that would be), but to the set that just consists of the number $0$: $\{0\}$.

Since vectors in $\bbR^2$ are pairs of numbers, you can draw them as points in the plane:

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[2, 3]} color='blue'/>
</Axes>

However the two operations associated with vectors (addition and scalar multiplication) are best represented by drawing a vector as an arrow:

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3]} color='blue'/>
</Axes>

Once you do this, adding vectors corresponds geometrically to gluing their arrows end to end:

<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3]} color='blue'/>
  <Vector disp={[-1, 1]} start={[2, 3]} color='red'/>
  <Vector disp={[1, 4]} color='purple' />
</Axes>

Here, $(2, 3)$ and $(-1, 1)$ add up to $(1, 4)$, and also if you stick the arrow for $(-1, 1)$ onto the end of the arrow for $(2, 3)$, you end up at the point $(1, 4)$.

The arrow notation helps indicate that vectors can be thought of as displacements. To start at $(-2, -2)$ and move 2 units in the $x$ direction and $3$ units in the $y$ direction means to append the arrow for $(2, 3)$ to the point $(-1, 1)$. You'll end up at the point $(-2, -2) + (2, 3) = (0, 1)$:

<Axes bounds={5}>
  <Point location={[-2, -2]} />
  <Vector disp={[2, 3]} start={[-2, -2]} color='blue'/>
  <Point location={[0, 1]} />
</Axes>

The arrow notation also works well for three-dimensional vectors: a vector in $\bbR^3$ is a point in 3-dimensional space. For example, here's the vector $(2, 3, 1)$:

<Axes three bounds={5}>
  <Point location={[2, 3, 1]} color='blue' />
</Axes>

which can also be represented by an arrow drawn from the origin to the point $(2, 3, 1)$:

<Axes three bounds={5}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3, 1]} color='blue' />
</Axes>

The arrow notation gives a geometric interpretation to vector addition. You stick one arrow on the end of the other:

<Axes three bounds={5}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3, 1]} color='blue' />
  <Vector disp={[-1, 1, 0]} start={[2, 3, 1]} color='red' />
  <Vector disp={[1, 4, 1]} color='purple' />
</Axes>

Scaling a vector merely stretches the arrow by that factor. For example, scaling a vector by a factor of $1.5$:

<Axes three bounds={5}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3, 1]} color='blue' opacity={0.5}/>
  <Vector disp={[3, 4.5, 1.5]} color='red' opacity={0.5} />
</Axes>

or scaling it by a factor of $0.5$ (so it shrinks):

<Axes three bounds={5}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3, 1]} color='blue' opacity={0.5} />
  <Vector disp={[1, 1.5, 0.5]} color='red' opacity={0.5} />
</Axes>

When writing vectors in coordinate form, it is often convenient to write them vertically, so that

$$
\bpm
2 \\
3 \\
1
\epm
$$

means the same thing as $(2, 3, 1)$. When you write a vector horizontally like $(2, 3, 1)$, it's called a "row vector" and when you write it vertically it's called a "column vector".


## Linear Independence and Span

Given a set of vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n$, a linear combination is a vector obtained by multiplying them by numbers and adding them together: $a_1v_1 + \cdots + a_nv_n$ for some numbers $a_1,\ldots, a_n$. For example,

$$
-\bpm 2 \\ 3\\ 1\epm + 3 \bpm -1 \\ 1\\ 0\epm
$$

is a linear combination of the two vectors

$$
\bpm 2 \\ 3\\ 1\epm, \bpm -1 \\ 1\\ 0 \epm
$$

Also,
$$
\bpm 2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \epm
$$
is a linear combination of the two vectors, since it's $1$ times the first and $0$ times to second. The zero vector

$$
\bpm 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\epm
$$

is a linear combination of the two vectors:

$$
\bpm 0\\ 0\\ 0\epm = 0\bpm 2 \\ 3 \\ 1\epm + 0 \bpm -1 \\ 1\\ 0 \epm
$$

By plotting a lot of linear combinations of the two vectors, you can see that all linear combinations of them seemt to lie on a plane:

<Axes three bounds={5}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3, 1]} color='blue' />
  <Vector disp={[-1, 1, 0]} color='red' />
  <Vector disp={[1, 4, 1]} color='purple' />
  <Vector disp={[0, 5, 1]} color='purple' />
  <Vector disp={[-3, -5, -2]} color='purple' />
  <Vector disp={[3, 2, 1]} color='purple' />
</Axes>

The set of linear combinations of a set of vectors is called the span of those vectors. In this case, the span of $(2, 3, 1)$ and $(-1, 1, 0)$ is a plane. Since the zero vector is always a linear combination, the span of any set of vectors will pass through the origin.

The span of a single vector is the set of scalar multiples of that vector:
<Axes three bounds={5}>
  <Vector disp={[2, 3, 1]} color='blue' opacity={0.5} />
  <Vector disp={[1, 1.5, 0.5]} color='red' opacity={0.5} />
  <Vector disp={[-2, -3, -1]} color='lightblue' opacity={0.5} />
  <Vector disp={[-1, -1.5, -0.5]} color='pink' opacity={0.5} />
</Axes>

and so the span of a single vector is always a line.

If $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ are vectors and $a_1v_1 + \cdots + a_nv_n = 0$ then one says that there is a linear relation between the vectors $v_1,\ldots, v_n$. This definition is perhaps a little silly since there's always the linear relation where each $a_i$ is $0$. If there is a relation where not all of the coefficients $a_i$ are $0$ (so at least one is nonzero), then the set of vectors $v_1,\ldots, v_n$ is said to be linearly independen. A linear relation where not all the coefficients $a_i$ are $0$ is called a nontrivial linear relation.

For example, there's a nontrivial relation between the vectors

$$
\bpm 2\\ 3\\ 1\epm, \bpm -1 \\ 1 \\ 0\epm, \bpm 1 \\ 4\\ 1\epm
$$

namely,

$$
\bpm 2\\ 3\\ 1\epm + \bpm -1\\ 1\\ 0\epm - \bpm 1\\ 4\\ 1\epm = \bpm 0\\ 0\\ 0\epm
$$

The three coefficients, $1$, $1$, and $-1$ respectively, are not all zero. Intuitively, a nontrivial linear relation means that at least one vector is in the span of the others. Here, for example:

$$
\bpm 1 \\ 4\\ 1\epm = \bpm 2 \\ 3 \\ 1\epm + \bpm -1\\ 1 \\ 0 \epm
$$

A collection is vectors is said to be linearly independent if there is no nontrivial linear relation between them. Intuitively, this means that no vector is the span of the other vectors. For example,

$$
\bpm 2\\ 3\\ 1\epm, \bpm -1\\ 1\\ 0\epm, \bpm 1\\ 4\\ 1\epm
$$

is not linearly independent because of the nontrivial linear relation between the three vectors. On the other hand,

$$
\bpm 2\\ 3\\ 1\epm, \bpm -1 \\ 1\\0 \epm
$$
is a linearly dependent set of vectors. To see this, let

$$
a_1 \bpm 2\\ 3\\ 1\epm + a_2 \bpm -1\\ 1 \\ 0\epm = \bpm 0 \\ 0\\ 0\epm
$$

be a linear relation between the vectors. Then the following three equations are satisfied:

$$
\begin{cases}
2a_1 - a_2 = 0\\
3a_1 + a_2 = 0\\
a_1 = 0
\end{cases}
$$

This is a system of three equations in two unknowns and so can be solved by row reducing:

$$
\baug{cc|c}
2 & -1 & 0\\
3 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0
\eaug
\to
\baug{cc|c}
1 & 0 &0 \\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\eaug
$$

From this augmented matrix, one can see that the only solution to the system is $a_1 = 0$ and $a_2 = 0$. Therefore the only relation between the two vectors is the trivial relation

$$
0\bpm 2\\3\\1\epm + 0\bpm -1 \\1\\ 0\epm = \bpm 0\\ 0\\ 0\epm
$$

If a set of vectors is not linearly independent, it is said to be linear dependent.

A set of vectors is a basis if it is both spanning and linearly independent. Here are two useful facts about bases:

1. If $v_1,\ldots, v_n$ is a basis, then any vector can be written uniquely as a linear combination of $v_1,\ldots, v_n$.
2. Any basis of $\bbR^n$ has exactly $n$ vectors.

The standard basis of $\bbR^n$ consists of the vectors $e_1,\ldots, e_n$ where $e_i$ is a vector with zeros in every coordinate, except for a $1$ in the $i$th entry. For example, the standard basis of $\bbR^2$ consists of

$$
e_1 = \bpm 1\\ 0 \epm,~e_2 = \bpm 0 \\ 1\epm
$$

and the standard basis of $\bbR^3$ consists of

$$
e_1 = \bpm 1 \\ 0\\ 0\epm,~e_2 = \bpm 0 \\ 1\\ 0 \epm,~e_3 = \bpm 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\epm
$$

## Maps of Sets

The functions you've seen before (like $f(x) = x^2$ or $f(x) = \sin(x)$ or $f(x) = e^x$ etc) are things that take as input a number and output another number. For example if $f(x) = x^2$, then if you input $5$ then $f$ will output $25$. This is written as $f(5) = 25$.

There's no reason that one must restrict inputs and outputs to all numbers. One can define functions that take as input elements in some set $X$ and output elements in some possibly different set $Y$. The sentence "f is a function that takes as inputs elements in $X$ and outputs $Y$" is written as

$$
f: X \to Y
$$

The set $X$ is called the domain of $f$ and the set $Y$ is called the codomain of $f$. So the domain is the set of inputs and the codomain is the set of possible outputs.

For example, if $X = \{0, 1, 2\}$ (the set containing the numbers $0$, $1$, and $2$) and $Y = \{0, 1\}$ (the set containing the numbers $0$ and $1$), then you can define a function

$$
f_1: \{ 0, 1, 2\} \to \{0, 1\}
$$

by

$f_1(0) = 0$, $f_1(1) = 0$, and $f_1(2) = 1$. The input $0$ outputs $0$, the input $1$ also outputs $0$, and the input $2$ outputs $1$.

For another example, define

$$
f_2: \{0, 1\} \to \{0, 1, 2\}
$$

by $f_2(0) = 1$ and $f_2(1) = 2$. The input $0$ outputs $1$ and the input $1$ outputs $2$.

If every element in the codomain output of at least one input then the function is called surjective. So $f_1$ is surjective but $f_2$ is not ($f_2$ is not surjective because $2$ is not an output of any input). If every output is the output of at most one input then the function is called injective. So $f_2$ is injective but $f_1$ is not ($f_1$ is not injective because $0$ is the output of two inputs).

Functions that are both surjective and injective are called bijective. Since surjective means that every element in the codomain is the output of at least one input and injective means that every element in the codomain is the output of at most one input, then bijective means that every element in the codomain is the output of precisely one input.

The functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ are not bijective: $f_1$ is not bijective because it is not injective and $f_2$ is not bijective because it is not surjective. Define

$$
f_3: \{0, 1, 2\} \to \{0, 1, 2\}
$$

by $f_3(0) = 1$, $f_3(1) = 2$, and $f_3(2) = 0$. Then every element in the codomain is the output of exactly one input, so $f_3$ is bijective. Since every element in the codomain of $f_3$ is the output of precisely one input, you can reverse $f_3$ by sending every output to its unique corresponding input. This function is called the inverse of $f_3$ and denoted $f_3^{-1}$:

$$
f_3^{-1}: \{0, 1, 2\} \to \{0, 1, 2\}
$$

where $f_3^{-1}(0) = 2$, $f_3^{-1}(1) = 0$, and $f_3^{-1}(2) = 1$. Said another way, $f_3^{-1}$ is obtained from $f_3$ by switching the inputs and outputs. Since bijective functions have inverses, the word bijective is often also called "invertible".

People often call "injective" functions "one-to-one" and "surjective" functions "onto". I don't like this terminology because "one-to-one" seems (to me) to connote bijectivity.

Functions are also called "maps" and "transformations". For most purposes "function", "map", and "transformation" are synonyms. Some people use "function" to refer to things whose codomain is $\bbR$, so I tend to use "map" or "transformation".

Here's a function from $\bbR^3$ to $\bbR^2$. Let

$$
f_4: \bbR^3 \to \bbR^2
$$

be defined by

$$
f_4(x, y, z) = (x^2 + y^2, x^2 - z^2)
$$

For example, the input $(1, 1, 1)$ outputs $(2, 0)$. Vectors in $\bbR^2$ and $\bbR^3$ are often written vertically for convenience, so you could also write

$$
f_4\bpm x\\ y\\z\epm = \bpm x^2 + y^2 \\ x^2 - z^2 \epm
$$

Another way to write this function is to use the symbol "$\mapsto$" which is read as "maps to":

$$
\bpm x \\y\\ z\epm \mapsto \bpm x^2 + y^2 \\ x^2 - z^2 \epm
$$

this might read as "a point $(x, y, z)$ is mapped to the point $(x^2 + y^2, x^2 - z^2)$".

The function $f_4$ is not injective, since $(1, 1, 1)$ and $(-1, 1, 1)$ are mapped to the same point. It is not surjective, because $x^2 + y^2$ is never negative. Therefore any point in the codomain with a negative first coordinate is not an output of $f_4$.


## Linear Maps

A linear map is a map from $\bbR^n\to \bbR^m$ (for some $n$ and $m$) like

$$
\bpm x\\ y\epm \mapsto \bpm x + y\\ x - y\epm
$$

or

$$
\bpm x \\ y \\ z \epm \mapsto \bpm 2x + y \\ -x -5y\epm
$$

or

$$
\bpm x\\y\\z \epm \mapsto \bpm 0\\ x \\ y\epm
$$

That is, every coordinate of the output is a sum of numbers times input coordinates. Notably, there are no terms like $x^2$ or $y^2$ or $\sin(z)$ in any of the output coordinates. And there are no nonzero constant terms, so something like

$$
\bpm x \\ y \\ z \epm \mapsto \bpm 1 \\ x + 2 \\ y \epm
$$

In order to define linear maps precisely, one takes a different more abstract view. A linear map $f: \bbR^n \to \bbR^m$ is a map such that

1. $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ (where $x$ and $y$ are vectors in $\bbR^n$)
2. $f(cx) = cf(x)$ (where $x$ is a vector in $\bbR^n$ and $c$ is a number).

Remember that a vector space is a set with two operations (addition and multiplication by numbers) and these two properties correspond to the two operations on vectors. For consistency's sake, perhaps linear maps should be called vector maps, or perhaps vector spaces should be called linear spaces, but the terminology is already too entrenched to be changed.

You can check that the three example of linear maps above in this section satisfy both of these properties. The best way to describe linear maps, however, is via matrices.


## Matrices and Matrix Multiplication

An $m\times n$ matrix is simply a grid of numbers. Here's a $2\times 3$ matrix:

$$
\bpm 1 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \epm
$$

and here's a $5\times 1$ matrix

$$
\bpm 1 \\ 2\\ -1 \\-1\\ 0\epm
$$
(essentially the same thing as a vector in $\bbR^5$!).

If $A$ is a matrix, then $A_{ij}$ refers to the entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column. Traditionally $i$ and $j$ are counted starting from $1$ (rather than 0), and $A_{ij}$ is often called the $i,j$th entry of $A$. For example, if

$$
A = \bpm 1 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \epm
$$

then $A_{12} = 1$ and $A_{13} = 0$.

The essential point about matrices is that you can "multiply" them. You can multiply an $m\times n$ matrix with an $n\times k$ matrix to get an $m\times k$ matrix. Exactly how you multiply matrices is best described by first descibing how to multiply a $1\times n$ matrix and an $n\times 1$ matrix. Take, for example,

$$
A = \bpm 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \epm
$$

$$
B = \bpm 4 \\ 5 \\ 6\\ 7\epm
$$

Then the product $A$ and $B$ is taken by multiplying each coordinate of $A$ with the corresponding coordinate of $B$, then adding them together:

$$
AB = \bpm 0 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 7 \epm
$$
Since $A$ is a $1\times n$ matrix and $B$ is a $n\times 1$ matrix, $AB$ is a $1\times 1$ matrix. Now let $A$ be a larger matrix, say, a $2\times 3$ matrix:

$$
A = \bpm 1 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 1\epm
$$

and let $B$ be a $3\times 2$ matrix, say,

$$
B = \bpm 1 & 2\\ -1 & 2\\ 0 & 0 \epm
$$

Then the product $AB$ is calculated as follows: the $ij$th entry of $AB$ is determined by multiplying the $i$th row of $A$ (a $1\times 3$ matrix) with the $j$th column of $B$ (a $3\times 1$ matrix):

$$
AB = \bpm 1 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 1\epm  \bpm 1 & 2\\ -1 & 2\\ 0 & 0 \epm = \bpm 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 0 & 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 0 \\ 0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot (-1) + 0 \\cdot 0 & 0 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 0 \epm = \bpm 0 & 4\\ -1 & 2 \epm
$$


You can also add two $m\times n$ matrices together:

$$
\bpm 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1\epm + \bpm 0 & 1 & 1\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \epm = \bpm 1 + 0 & 1 + 1 & 0 + 1 \\ 0 + 1 & 1 + 0 & 1 + 0 \epm = \bpm 1 & 2 & 1\\ 1 & 1 & 1\epm
$$

and you can multiply matrices by scalars:

$$
5\cdot \bpm 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1\epm = \bpm 5 & 5 & 0\\ 0 & 5 & 5\epm
$$

(so, the set of $m\times n$ matrices forms a vector space).

Matrix addition and multiplication has the following properties:

1. $(AB)C = A(BC)$, that is, the order in which you multiply pairs of matrices doesn't matter.
2. $(A + B)C = AC + BC$ and $A(B + C) = AB = AC$.
3. If $A$ and $B$ are matrices and $c$ is a number, then $(cA)B = A(cB)$.

It is not necessarily true that $AB$ is equal to $BA$. For example

$$
\bpm 1 & 1 \\ 0  & 1\epm bpm 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1\epm = \bpm 2 & 1\\ 1 &1 \epm
$$

where

$$
\bpm 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \epm \bpm 1 & 1\\ 0 & 1\epm = \bpm 1 & 1\\ 1 & 2\epm
$$


## Matrices, Linear Maps, and Composition

If $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix, define a map $\bbR^n\to \bbR^m$ as

$$
x\mapsto Ax
$$

where $x$ here is a vector in $\bbR^n$ written vertically, so that it can be thought of as an $n\times 1$ matrix. Since $A$ is $m\times n$, the product $Ax$ is $m\times 1$, and hence can be thought of as a vector in $\bbR^m$ written vertically. For example, let

$$
A = \bpm 1 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 1\epm
$$

then the map $x\mapsto Ax$ is

$$
\bpm x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \epm \mapsto \bpm 1 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 1\epm \bpm x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \epm = \bpm x_1 + x_2\\ x_2 + x_3 \epm
$$

This map is linear because $A(x + y) = Ax + Ay$ and (cA)x = A(cx)$ by two of the properties of matrix multiplication. It is a fact that any linear map from $\bbR^n$ to $\bbR^m$ is $x\mapsto Ax$ for some $m\times n$ matrix $A$.

Given maps $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y\to Z$, the outputs of $f$ are inputs of $g$ so you can "compose" $f$ and $g$ by inputting the outputs of $f$ into $g$. That is, $f$ composed with $g$ is the map $x\mapsto g(f(x))$. Note the weird order here where $g$ is applied after $f$ but appears to the left of $f$ in the notation. The map $x\mapsto g(f(x))$ is often denoted $g\circ f$, so that $(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$.

If $f:\bbR^n\to \bbR^m$ is defined by $Ax$ for some $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and $f:\bbR^m\to \bbR^k$ is defined by $Bx$ for some $n\times k$ matrix $B$, then $(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = BAx$. So the composition of $f$ then $g$, $g\circ f$, is the linear map determined by the matrix $BA$. So composition of linear maps corresponds to matrix multiplication.
