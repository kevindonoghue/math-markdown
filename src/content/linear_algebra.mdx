# Linear Algebra

## What is Linear Algebra?
Linear algebra is the study of mathematical objects that you can add:
$$a+b$$
and that you can multiply by numbers
$$5a.$$
A vector space is a set where you can add elements of the set together and where you can multiply any element in the set by a number.

For example, the set of pairs of numbers (things like $(-1, 0)$ or $(5, 7)$ or $(1.5, 2.5)$, $(3, 5)$ etc) form a vector space:
- you can add any two of them together: $(-1, 0) + (5, 7) = (4, 7)$
- you can multiply any of them by a number: $0.5\cdot(3, 5) = (1.5, 2.5)$.

For example, the set of triples of numbers (things like $(-1, 0, 0)$ or $(3, 2, 1)$ or $(-2.4, 1.6, 0)$) form a vector space:
- you can add any two of them together: $(-1, 0, 0) + (3, 2, 1) = (2, 2, 1)$
- you can multiply any of them by a number: $2\cdot(3, 2, 1) = (6, 4, 2)$

Similarly for quadruples of numbers, quintuples of numbers, $n$-tuples of numbers.

The set of pairs of numbers is called $\bbR^2$. The set of triples of numbers is called $\bbR^3$. The set of $n$-tuples of numbers is called $\bbR^n$. There are more vector spaces than these, but it is helpful to just focus on these vector spaces first.

There are two other vector spaces not mentioned thus far, but that are important. First, the set of numbers themselves, $\bbR$ forms a vector space. And the set containing only zero, $\{0\}$, is a vector space.

## Linear Systems of Equations
In practice, most problems in linear algebra reduce to solving systems of linear equations. This is a linear equation in two variables:
$$x + 2y = 3$$
It is linear because it can be written as a sum of numbers times the variables. There are no powers bigger than 1 ($x^2$) or funky functions ($\sin(x)$) lying around. If this definition seems unsatisfying and unintuitive, that's ok. We'll revisit it in the future.

The set of solutions to the equation $x + 2y = 3$ is the set of pairs of numbers $(x, y)$ such that $x + 2y = 3$. For example, $(1, 1)$ is a solution, as is $(3, 0)$.

The set of pairs of numbers can be plotted on the cartesian axis:
<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1]} />
  <Point location={[3, 0]} />
</Axes>

Pictured above are two solutions to the equation $x + 2y = 3$. If you plot enough solutions, you see that they form a line:
<Axes bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1]} />
  <Point location={[3, 0]} />
  <Point location={[0, 1.5]} />
  <Point location={[-1, 2]} />
  <Point location={[2, 0.5]} />
  <Point location={[3, 0]} />
  <Point location={[4, -0.5]} />
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y) => x + 2*y - 3} opacity={0.5} color={'blue'}/>
</Axes>

Therefore I might refer to "the line $x + 2y = 3$". This means the same thing as "the set of pairs of points $(x, y)$ such that $x + 2y = 3$" and the same thing as "the set of solutions to $x + 2y = 3$".

Here is a linear equation, in three variables:
$$x + 2y - z = 1.$$
The set of solutions of this equation is the set of triples of numbers $(x, y, z)$ such that $x + 2y -z = 1$. For example, $(1, 1, 2)$ is a solution, as is $(-1, 1.5, 1)$.

The set of triples of numbers can be plotted on a 3-dimensional cartesian axis:
<Axes dim={3} bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1, 2]} />
  <Point location={[-1, 1.5, 1]} />
</Axes>

Above I have plotted two solutions to $x + 2y - z = 1$. If you plot lots of solutions, you can see that they form a plane:
<Axes dim={3} bounds={[[-5, 5], [-5, 5], [-5, 5]]}>
  <Point location={[1, 1, 2]} />
  <Point location={[-1, 1.5, 1]} />
  <Point location={[2, 1, 3]} />
  <Point location={[2, -1, -1]} />
  <Point location={[0, 0.5, 0]} />
  <Point location={[0, 2.5, 4]} />
  <Point location={[-0.5, 0, -1.5]} />
  <Point location={[0, 0, -1]} />
  <ZeroSet f={(x, y, z) => x + 2*y - z - 1} opacity={0.25} color={'blue'}/>
</Axes>

(How did I get these solutions? I fixed two of the coordinates and then determined the third. For example, for $(1, 1, 2)$, I said "suppose $x=1$ and $y=1$, then $z$ must be such that $1 + (2\cdot 1) - z = 1$, so $z$ must be $1 + 2 - 1 = 2$".) Therefore, I might refer to "the plane $x + 2y - z = 1$", which is the same thing as "the set of pairs of points $(x, y)$ such that $x + 2y - z = 1$" which is the same as "the set of solutions to $x + 2y - z = 1$".
